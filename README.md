## Project Desription:

Project  aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas [Data]([https://github.com/](https://github.com/wafemi999/etl-pipeline-bash-airflow/tree/main/tolldata))
. Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with a different IT setup that uses different file formats. My aim is to collect the  data available in different formats and consolidate it into a single file.

## Objectives:
* Extract data from a csv file
* Extract data from a tsv file
* Extract data from a fixed width file
* Transform the data 

 ## Technology Stack:
